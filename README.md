Free and open source Tibia dat editor written in C# using WPF, used to edit tibia dat file with protocol 7.72, it might work on older, but I'm not sure about that.

You can download binary file from releases section or compile it yourself. 

To compile it yourself you will need Visual Studio 2017 and support for c# and wpf apps, then you just hit the build button!
Output file will be placed into IlMerge directory.
